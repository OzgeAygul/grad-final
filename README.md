# Project Title: Dynamic Course Scheduling via Mathematical Optimization

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a scrollytelling website that demystifies mathematical optimization in university scheduling for nonexpert stakeholders. My aim is to make complex algorithms accessible and relatable through interactive storytelling and data visualization.

## Contents

- `python_codes/`: Code developed for the project's interactive visualizations.
- `lib/`: External libraries used, including Idyll for scrollytelling and d3.js for dynamic visualizations.
- `data/`: Dataset used in the visualizations, provided by WPI and processed by our mathematical optimization algorithm.

## Interactive Visualizations

Our project includes several types of interactive visualizations:
- Treemaps for comparing classroom utilization
- Scatterplots for highlighting space optimization
- Tradeoff visualizations to explore the impact of increased student numbers

Each visualization is designed to be user-friendly and informative, with interactivity at its core.

## Technical and Design Improvements

We've implemented a responsive design to ensure accessibility across devices and improved navigation cues for better user engagement. We plan to further refine these elements based on user feedback.

## Non-Obvious Features

- Interactive elements within the treemaps allow users to drill down for detailed data.
- The scatterplot visualization includes a feature for users to select specific data points and see related information.
- Our tradeoff visualization dynamically updates as users scroll, providing an engaging narrative experience.

We invite you to explore the website, interact with the data, and learn about the power of optimization in university settings.
