## Dynamic Course Scheduling for Strategic University Scaling via Mathematical Optimization

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a scrollytelling website that demystifies mathematical optimization in university scheduling for nonexpert stakeholders. My aim is to make complex algorithms accessible and relatable through interactive storytelling and data visualization.

## Contents

- `python_codes/`: Code developed for the project's interactive visualizations.
- `lib/`: External libraries used, including Idyll for scrollytelling and d3.js for dynamic visualizations.
- `data/`: Dataset used in the visualizations, processed by our mathematical optimization algorithm. Data provided by WPI is not included.

## Interactive Visualizations

- **Treemap**: An interactive treemap visualization shows the actual vs. optimized usage of university spaces, allowing users to explore space efficiency at a granular level.
- **Scatter Plot**: This plot contrasts actual and optimized space utilization over time, with bubble sizes representing space capacity, offering insights into optimization potential.
- **Tradeoff Visualization**: A dynamic visualization that illustrates the trade-offs between increasing student enrollment and the required number of course sections.


## Technical and Design Achievements

I've implemented a responsive design to ensure improved navigation cues for better user engagement.

## Non-Obvious Features

- Interactive elements within the treemaps allow users to drill down for detailed data.
- The scatterplot visualization includes a feature for users to select specific data points and see related information.
- Our tradeoff visualization dynamically updates as users scroll, providing an engaging narrative experience.

We invite you to explore the website, interact with the data, and learn about the power of optimization in university settings.
