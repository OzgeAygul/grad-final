## Dynamic Course Scheduling for Strategic University Scaling via Mathematical Optimization

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a scrollytelling website that demystifies mathematical optimization in university scheduling for nonexpert stakeholders. My aim is to make complex algorithms accessible and relatable through interactive storytelling and data visualization.

## Contents

- `python_codes/`: Code developed for the project's interactive visualizations.
- `lib/`: External libraries used, including Idyll for scrollytelling and d3.js for dynamic visualizations.
- `data/`: Dataset used in the visualizations, processed by our mathematical optimization algorithm. Data provided by WPI is not included.

## Interactive Visualizations

- **Treemap**: An interactive treemap visualization shows the actual vs. optimized usage of university spaces, allowing users to explore space efficiency at a granular level.
- **Scatter Plot**: This plot contrasts actual and optimized space utilization over time, with bubble sizes representing space capacity, offering insights into optimization potential.
- **Tradeoff Visualization**: A dynamic visualization that illustrates the trade-offs between increasing student enrollment and the required number of course sections.


## Technical and Design Achievements

My project showcases several technical and design achievements:

- **Responsive Design**: The website adapts seamlessly across different devices, enhancing accessibility and usability.
- **Advanced Interactivity**: Interactive elements and responsive visualizations actively engage users, fostering a deeper understanding of data insights.
- **Design Principles**: I adhered to key design principles including:
  - **Hierarchy**: Visual hierarchy is used effectively to guide the userâ€™s attention to the most important data first.
  - **Consistency**: The visual and interaction design across the website is consistent, enhancing the user's learning curve and comfort with navigating complex information.
  - **Simplicity**: The interface is designed to be clean and uncluttered, prioritizing ease of use and minimizing cognitive overload.
  - **Color Usage**: Colors are used not just for aesthetic but strategically to denote different data types and to highlight critical data points.

These achievements contribute to a sophisticated yet user-friendly interface that makes complex optimization data accessible and engaging to non-expert stakeholders.

## Non-Obvious Features

- Interactive elements within the treemaps allow users to drill down for detailed data.
- The scatterplot visualization includes a feature for users to select specific data points and see related information.
- Our tradeoff visualization dynamically updates as users scroll, providing an engaging narrative experience.

I invite you to explore the website, interact with the data, and learn about the power of optimization in university settings.
